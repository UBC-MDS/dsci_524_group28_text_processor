This allows users to generate insights on and clean raw text data without needing to manually read the file or write the text to a new file, and is particularly useful in cases where users only need to perform a simple operation on the text file.\nThe package consists of the following functions:\n\ntext_lower:\n\nThis function converts all characters in a text file to lower case and writes it to a specified file.\n\ntext_find:\n\nThis function finds the index of the first instance of a specified string in a text file. If the string does not exist in the file, it will return -1.\n\ntext_remove:\n\nThis function removes all instances of a specified string in a text file, then writes it to a new file.\n\ntext_replace:\n\nThis function replaces all instances of a specified string in a text file with another string, then writes it to a new file.\n\n\n\n\nThe functions in text_processor are analogous to built-in string methods in the Python standard library such as str.lower(), str.find(), and str.replace(). They are differentiated by how they are built to handle text files specifically, directly reading from and writing to files rather than working directly with the text as strings.\n\n\n\nOur online documentation can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this GitHub repository and navigate to the project folder using the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci_524_group28_text_processor.git\ncd dsci_524_group28_text_processor\n\n\n\nCreate and activate the development environment using the environment.yml file:\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate 524\n\n\n\nTo install the package locally for testing, use the following command while in the root directory:\npip install -e .\nTo instead install the package from TestPyPI, use the following command:\npip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ text-processor\n\n\n\nRun the tests using the following command while in the root directory:\npytest\n\n\n\nAfter installing text_processor, the documentation can be built using Hatch with the following command:\nquartodoc build\n\n\n\nThe documentation is automatically rendered and deployed once updates are pushed to the deployment branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAitong Wu\nChristine Chow\nJulia Zhang\nVy Phan\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2026 Julia Zhang, Vy Phan, Aitong Wu, Christine Chow.\nFree software distributed under the MIT License."

    "text": "Package\n \n\n\nMeta\n\n\n\n\ntext_processor is a package that assists in the processing of text files in Python. This allows users to generate insights on and clean raw text data without needing to manually read the file or write the text to a new file, and is particularly useful in cases where users only need to perform a simple operation on the text file.\nThe package consists of the following functions:\n\ntext_lower:\n\nThis function converts all characters in a text file to lower case and writes it to a specified file.\n\ntext_find:\n\nThis function finds the index of the first instance of a specified string in a text file. If the string does not exist in the file, it will return -1.\n\ntext_remove:\n\nThis function removes all instances of a specified string in a text file, then writes it to a new file.\n\ntext_replace:\n\nThis function replaces all instances of a specified string in a text file with another string, then writes it to a new file.\n\n\n\n\nThe functions in text_processor are analogous to built-in string methods in the Python standard library such as str.lower(), str.find(), and str.replace(). They are differentiated by how they are built to handle text files specifically, directly reading from and writing to files rather than working directly with the text as strings.\n\n\n\nOur online documentation can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this GitHub repository and navigate to the project folder using the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci_524_group28_text_processor.git\ncd dsci_524_group28_text_processor\n\n\n\nCreate and activate the development environment using the environment.yml file:\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate 524\n\n\n\nTo install the package locally for testing, use the following command while in the root directory:\npip install -e .\nTo instead install the package from TestPyPI, use the following command:\npip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ text-processor\n\n\n\nRun the tests using the following command while in the root directory:\npytest\n\n\n\nAfter installing text_processor, the documentation can be built using Hatch with the following command:\nquartodoc build\n\n\n\nThe documentation is automatically rendered and deployed once updates are pushed to the deployment branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAitong Wu\nChristine Chow\nJulia Zhang\nVy Phan\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2026 Julia Zhang, Vy Phan, Aitong Wu, Christine Chow.\nFree software distributed under the MIT License.",
