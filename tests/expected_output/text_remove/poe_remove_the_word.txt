It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by  sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By  name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by  sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that  wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me.

And this was  reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by  sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by  sea.

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me-
Yes!—that was  reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by  sea)
That  wind came out of  cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than  love
   Of those who were older than we—
   Of many far wiser than we—
And neither  angels in Heaven above
   Nor  demons down under  sea
Can ever dissever my soul from  soul
   Of  beautiful Annabel Lee;

For  moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of  beautiful Annabel Lee;
And  stars never rise, but I feel  bright eyes
   Of  beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all  night-tide, I lie down by  side
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by  sea—
   In her tomb by  sounding sea.
